# CCalc
Calculus tools for numerical methods written in C.
## Still in heavy development 
### What it currently supports:
  - Single variable integration
    - What you see from the fundemental theorem of calculus
  - Single variable differentiation of different orders
    - Basic differentiation with a limiting difference quotient. Can work with n-th derivative
  - Taylor Series Expansion
    - Slight Warning. This one's a bit limited due to floating point rounding.
  - N-tuple integration
    - This includes both Type I & II Regions (well any region of space, plane, line, hyperspace)...
  - Root finding
    - Implementation of Newton's method. Converges to roots pretty quickly

### Prospective features:
#### - Line integrals
#### - Jacobian transforms
#### - Vector functions and operations
#### - Differentiation of several variables
#### - Some form of interpreter to execute each feature sequentially
#### - Minimum/Max/Saddle point finding
#### - Matrices & Operations
